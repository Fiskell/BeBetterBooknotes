Upstream Effects #1: Upstream Effects (96 - 244)

> There's nearly an infinite number of things we can do with our time, and I know that if I'm exhausted or scattered, I'm unlikely to make great choices.

What I have noticed to be especially interesting about not getting enough sleep is that if you are angry or stressed out that it is hard for me to detect this, however I get the feedback from others.  So having good habits is more important since self regulation of emotions is such a hard skill to fully grasp

> What went right today?
> What would I do differently?
> What environmental things affected me?
> What should I start working on immediately tomorrow morning?
> Tomorrow's wake time:

Great firebreak questions, I do a weekly check in, but as a daily check in, I think I may adopt many of these questions.

> You win greater levels of control by taking action and setting up your life now so that your life runs better in the future.

Creating healthy habits is so difficult, since they take disipline to build up and next to nothing to tear down.  I wonder what systems can be put in place to make the tear down of good habits as hard to do as building habits.  Having constant reminders of the end goal / process is always good.

> You gain that agency by doing things right now, upstream, so that things run better downstream.

Set up habits so that every day you are reaping benefits from good habits.

> It's like, things get written on their to-do list at the bottom, but the stuff at the top never gets done. It just gets longer and longer.

Don't be a person of ever growing to-do's.  Throw away what you can't get done and focus on priorities.  See Warren Buffett's 5/25 rule

> "For us in SEAL Team, work was only over once we were physically back home. The conventional wisdom said that the operation wasn't over until we were actually back in the showers at home. Up until that point, nothing could be taken for granted. When you are going toward your extraction point after you have taken out your primary target, you can get ambushed on the way home. Once back, when you're cleaning your gear, putting everything away so that you are set up for the next mission, you could have a loaded round in your weapon and accidentally shoot yourself or someone else through carelessness or lack of attention. There were times I was so dog-tired after a twenty-hour day in the field, I had to fight the call of sleep during that final half hour it would take to clean my M14. It was a chore that I would have loved to have blown off were it not for the fact that my training drilled into me the fact that a professional doesn't quit until every task is complete". - Unleash the Warrior Within


> Over the last couple years, one repeatedly fruitful conversation at salon has been: "how much time are people actually thinking and making decisions"

This is a great question that seems to come up for me every night around 10pm.  My brain is worn down so it is no longer moving a million miles an hour.
I have time to think about what I want and reflect on how the day went.  Unfortunately it also means I am tired and usually out of energy and will to do the thing.

> But you can't fight your life as a series of moment-by-moment struggles. If you do, sometimes you'll clean your gear and put it away, and sometimes you'll lose the struggle and take the lazy way out.

Entrainment, consistency.  There is a fundamental lack of trust I have for myself due to the monkey brain.  To 

> Doing a weekly review every single Sunday, and making that the first thing you do on Sunday -- Entrainment.

I do a firebreak every sunday using google forms.  I didn't know or read about weekly checkins, it had just felt like a natural thing to do.  I was delighted to find out that Sebastian also does them.

> Willpower is great to get things moving, and terrible for keeping things moving.

This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes: "Inspiration is perishable".  
Whenever I have to do an activity fueled by willpower I stop and question my methods first.  If I believe that I can do the action consistently, and that I want to be doing the thing, then I continue.  There are of course exceptions, for example I may use willpower to get rote tasks complete that I have been putting off.

> In other words, when I come out of a fever, wash the sweat from my body, I start thinking -- maybe everyday life is a life of fever and illness; maybe I'm capable of much more.

I agree with Sebastian so much on this point.  Ever time I am sick I constantly tell myself that once I am over with this illness, I will appreciate life more.
But as creatures of equilibrium, we always fall back to w/e the daily norms are.  Even knowing ones own potential or even what 10% better looks like is outside of reach.
Finding ones own utility, limits, and desires really takes a consistent, committed effort.  Firebreaks are a great start.

> My rates of eating right, working in the morning, following good habits -- all of these fell apart after about three nights in a row of bad sleep.

I cannot remember the last week where I remained disciplined  in all that I wanted to accomplish:
Diet, Exercise, Work, Side Project, Social.  It is hard to ever remember a time where I accomplished two of my desired activities consistently.

I have not tinkered with sleep patterns enough to know how it affects my ability to manage myself. Sebastian speaks so highly of sleep as a root of habitual evil.

> Take very seriously your personal biochemistry, nutrition, consumption, rest, work, athletics, and environment. Experiment gradually to find out what works for you, and implement it.

Experimentation with oneself I find to be so much fun.  I am a hearty believer in ketosis.  The effects it had on my mental state alone are amazing.  It is also cool seeing the side effects of such a diet, such as leg grams (lack of potassium), and the 'keto' flu (headache, diarrhea, foggy mind).  I also feel like a damn scientist ever time I have to pee on a keto stick to track progress.

> Study what performance oriented people do.

This was a sub bullet to the above point but I really love how it is stated.  Performance oriented is a really interesting trait, not something I normally identify with most people.  Although when I
see people who have consistent success it is normally this excact trait.  I would say that by reading this book and compiling notes that I am studying a performance oriented person already. =)
