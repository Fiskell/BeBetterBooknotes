Why I chose it
======
I have read many books on Stoicism and have adopted many methods into my life of stoic thinking.  The book I come back to
again and again is 'The Art of Living' by Sharon Lebell.  It really struck a cord and made me want to dig deeper.
The obstacle is the way has been a book that pop's up in countless articles and podcasts, reinforcing my need to give it a read.
Stoicism has been so influential within my own life that this book was chosen as the first book in our 'Be Better Bookclub' at my work.

Notes
======

Preface
------
> *The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.*

This powerful quote is where the title of the book comes from.


> [stoicism] A formula for thriving not just in spite of whatever happens but *because of it*.

Another quote about obstacles, this one reminds me a bit of how overcoming failures is an antifragile system


Section 1
------
> you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are
but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure.

A common theme in stoicism, spend energy towards things that are within your control.

> Situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad.

It is how we interpret a situation that put's a label on it.  Our conditioning, our beliefs, our social pressures, things we can all re-realize, and change.

> Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. --Shakespeare


> An employee in your company makes a careless mistake that costs you business, This can be exactly what you spend so
much time and effort trying to avoid. *Or*, with a shift in perception, it can be exactly what you were looking for -- the chance
to pierce through defenses and teach a lesson that can be learned only by experience. A *mistake* becomes *training*.

This block of text perfectly describes day to day involvement with other software engineers.  A complex job with many
opportunities for failure.  It is important when something does go wrong to step back, take a breath, and remember
that I too have failed, and ofter failed harder.  How can we learn and improve?

> Just because other people say that something is hopeless or crazy or broken to pieces doesn't mean it is.  
We decide what story to tell ourselves.

It is easy to listen to other's negativity.  Often we create a state of learned helplessness.  
It doesn't have to end that way, AAA (action is always the answer) and in this case, action is how we think about situations.

> The risk of being overwhelmed is always there

Driving home again that we have a choice and that we choose to have events affect us

> talent is not the most sought-after characteristic. Grace and poise are.

If we see someone who can handle themselves well under pressure then they show immense strength, It would make sense why I would
want to be like that person and why grace and poise are so highly valued.  Someone who is at ease with themselves.

> There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up.

Unless it ends in our own death, we can and must always continue. There are still options, choices, that we make to construct a life of meaning.

> If your nerve holds, then nothing really did "happen" -- our perception made sure it was nothing of consequence.

Negative events occur when we view them as such, perceive what you want to and choose to believe.  Seeing is important, but how you see is even more important.

> Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself. -- Publius Syrus

This quote reminds me of another, "The greatest form of mastery is master over oneself".

> **apatheia**: It's the kind of calm equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions. Not the
loss of feeling altogether, just the loss of the harmful, unhelpful kind.

This quote hits on a common misconception that people have about stoicism.  Often people will label someone as 'stoic' who looks
hollow or silent with an angry look on their face.  Being 'stoic' is not a lack of emotions, just not acknowledgement
of negative ones.

> "When you worry, ask yourself, 'What am I choosing to not see right now?'" -- Gavin de Becker

This reminds me of another quote: "It's what you are not willing to see, that is what holds you back".  It is easy to fall
into a fixed mindset and choose not to look at our lives and actions objectively.  Without doing so means that we are limiting 
ourselves to change and adapt to an ever changing environment.

> Does getting upset provide you with more options?

The answer is often, no, of course not.  Yet it is so easy to get upset.  Excercising the principles laid out in Stoicism
means internalizing this and constantly taking action and re-adjusting to not get upset without just cause.

> If you need to take a moment, by all means, go ahead.  Real strength lies in the *control* or, as Nassim Taleb put it
the *domestication* of one's emotions.

It is a path of least resistance to allow emotions to flow freely without stopping to think about them.  This is why calling 
control over emotions 'real strength' is so powerful.  Strength to me is correlated with practice, and exercise of this 
emotional muscle.

> Wouldn't you be better off applying some of that resourcefulness rather than anger?"

This reminds me of the book *The slight edge* where in, it mentions the idea of always having a choice, no matter how small
to either get better, or worse.  When we choose anger, we choose to not take that step towards becoming better.
