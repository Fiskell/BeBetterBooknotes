About the book

Why I chose it
======
I have read many books on Stoicism and have adopted many methods into my life of stoic thinking.  The book I come back to
again and again is 'The Art of Living' by Sharon Lebell.  It really struck a cord and made me want to dig deeper.
The obstacle is the way has been a book that pop's up in countless articles and podcasts, reinforcing my need to give it a read.
Stoicism has been so influential within my own life that this book was chosen as the first book in our 'Be Better Bookclub' at my work.
