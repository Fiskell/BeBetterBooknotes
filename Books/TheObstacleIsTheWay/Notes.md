Why I chose it
======
I have read many books on Stoicism and have adopted many methods into my life of stoic thinking.  The book I come back to
again and again is 'The Art of Living' by Sharon Lebell.  It really struck a cord and made me want to dig deeper.
The obstacle is the way has been a book that pop's up in countless articles and podcasts, reinforcing my need to give it a read.
Stoicism has been so influential within my own life that this book was chosen as the first book in our 'Be Better Bookclub' at my work.

Notes
======

Preface
------
> *The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.*

This powerful quote is where the title of the book comes from.


> [stoicism] A formula for thriving not just in spite of whatever happens but *because of it*.

Another quote about obstacles, this one reminds me a bit of how overcoming failures is an antifragile system


Section 1
------
> you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are
but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure.

A common theme in stoicism, spend energy towards things that are within your control.

> Situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad.

It is how we interpret a situation that put's a label on it.  Our conditioning, our beliefs, our social pressures, things we can all re-realize, and change.

> Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. --Shakespeare

> An employee in your company makes a careless mistake that costs you business, This can be exactly what you spend so
much time and effort trying to avoid. *Or*, with a shift in perception, it can be exactly what you were looking for -- the chance
to pierce through defenses and teach a lesson that can be learned only by experience. A *mistake* becomes *training*.

This block of text perfectly describes day to day involvement with other software engineers.  A complex job with many
opportunities for failure.  It is important when something does go wrong to step back, take a breath, and remember
that I too have failed, and ofter failed harder.  How can we learn and improve?

> Just because other people say that something is hopeless or crazy or broken to pieces doesn't mean it is.  
We decide what story to tell ourselves.

It is easy to listen to other's negativity.  Often we create a state of learned helplessness.  
It doesn't have to end that way, AAA (action is always the answer) and in this case, action is how we think about situations.
