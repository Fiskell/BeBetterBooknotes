Why I chose it
======
I have read many books on Stoicism and have adopted many methods into my life of stoic thinking.  The book I come back to
again and again is 'The Art of Living' by Sharon Lebell.  It really struck a cord and made me want to dig deeper.
The obstacle is the way has been a book that pop's up in countless articles and podcasts, reinforcing my need to give it a read.
Stoicism has been so influential within my own life that this book was chosen as the first book in our 'Be Better Bookclub' at my work.

Notes

Preface
------
> *The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.*

This powerful quote is where the title of the book comes from.


> [stoicism] A formula for thriving not just in spite of whatever happens but *because of it*.

Another quote about obstacles, this one reminds me a bit of how overcoming failures is an antifragile system


Section 1 -- Perception
------
> you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are
but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure.

A common theme in stoicism, spend energy towards things that are within your control.

> Situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad.

It is how we interpret a situation that put's a label on it.  Our conditioning, our beliefs, our social pressures, things we can all re-realize, and change.

> Nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. --Shakespeare

-

> An employee in your company makes a careless mistake that costs you business, This can be exactly what you spend so
much time and effort trying to avoid. *Or*, with a shift in perception, it can be exactly what you were looking for -- the chance
to pierce through defenses and teach a lesson that can be learned only by experience. A *mistake* becomes *training*.

This block of text perfectly describes day to day involvement with other software engineers.  A complex job with many
opportunities for failure.  It is important when something does go wrong to step back, take a breath, and remember
that I too have failed, and ofter failed harder.  How can we learn and improve?

> Just because other people say that something is hopeless or crazy or broken to pieces doesn't mean it is.  
We decide what story to tell ourselves.

It is easy to listen to other's negativity.  Often we create a state of learned helplessness.  
It doesn't have to end that way, AAA (action is always the answer) and in this case, action is how we think about situations.

> The risk of being overwhelmed is always there

Driving home again that we have a choice and that we choose to have events affect us

> talent is not the most sought-after characteristic. Grace and poise are.

If we see someone who can handle themselves well under pressure then they show immense strength, It would make sense why I would
want to be like that person and why grace and poise are so highly valued.  Someone who is at ease with themselves.

> There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up.

Unless it ends in our own death, we can and must always continue. There are still options, choices, that we make to construct a life of meaning.

> If your nerve holds, then nothing really did "happen" -- our perception made sure it was nothing of consequence.

Negative events occur when we view them as such, perceive what you want to and choose to believe.  Seeing is important, but how you see is even more important.

> Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself. -- Publius Syrus

This quote reminds me of another, "The greatest form of mastery is master over oneself".

> **apatheia**: It's the kind of calm equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions. Not the
loss of feeling altogether, just the loss of the harmful, unhelpful kind.

This quote hits on a common misconception that people have about stoicism.  Often people will label someone as 'stoic' who looks
hollow or silent with an angry look on their face.  Being 'stoic' is not a lack of emotions, just not acknowledgement
of negative ones.

> "When you worry, ask yourself, 'What am I choosing to not see right now?'" -- Gavin de Becker

This reminds me of another quote: "It's what you are not willing to see, that is what holds you back".  It is easy to fall
into a fixed mindset and choose not to look at our lives and actions objectively.  Without doing so means that we are limiting 
ourselves to change and adapt to an ever changing environment.

> Does getting upset provide you with more options?

The answer is often, no, of course not.  Yet it is so easy to get upset.  Excercising the principles laid out in Stoicism
means internalizing this and constantly taking action and re-adjusting to not get upset without just cause.

> If you need to take a moment, by all means, go ahead.  Real strength lies in the *control* or, as Nassim Taleb put it
the *domestication* of one's emotions.

It is a path of least resistance to allow emotions to flow freely without stopping to think about them.  This is why calling 
control over emotions 'real strength' is so powerful.  Strength to me is correlated with practice, and exercise of this 
emotional muscle.

> Wouldn't you be better off applying some of that resourcefulness rather than anger?"

This reminds me of the book *The slight edge* where in, it mentions the idea of always having a choice, no matter how small
to either get better, or worse.  When we choose anger, we choose to not take that step towards becoming better.

*[Book]: Book of Five Rings*

> How often do we see what we think is there or should be there, instead of what actually is there?

Looking objectively is a hard skill, one that needs constant attention.  Removing assumptions from what we see, or don't, is a difficult task.

> The stoics use contempt as an agent to lay things bare and " *to strip away the legend that encrusts them* "

> Marcus Aurelius had a version of this exercise where he'd describe glamorous or expensive things without their euphemism.
-- roasted meat is a dead animal and vintage wine is old, fermented grapes.

> Objectivity means removing "you" -- the subjective part -- from the equation.

Putting anything on a pedestal limits our ability to truly *see* it for what it is.  By taking it down to it's bare components
we are able to look at it objectively.

> With other people we can be objective ... Take your situation and pretend it is not happening to you ... give yourself
clarity, not sympathy.

By removing ourselves from the issue at hand we are able to answer real questions easier, faster, and without as much
emotional involvement.

> Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. 
By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. -- Viktor Frankl

Frankl's case is one of the most extreme circumstance, his actions prove that this way of thinking and being is not
an idealistic principle, but rather one that is rooted in reality if we choose to accept it.

*[Person]: General Pericles*

> *Perspective is everything* : That is, when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you.

If you let your mind fixate on an issue without trying to deconstruct it, then you will start tearing yourself apart.
Keep dissecting it, from different angles. This way you can always be action oriented, trying new things.  Solve the problem, don't make it a bigger problem.

> The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away ... break it apart.

Simply ignoring our issues makes us hollow and will prevent us from doing what is most important, to iterate and get better.
By ignoring issues, we will not be able to know what we can change, what we like or dislike.

> It's your choice whether you want to put *I* in front of something ( *I hate public speaking. I screwed up. I am harmed by this.* )
These add an extra element: *you* in relation to that obstacle, rather than just the obstacle itself.

It is easy to make issues bigger than they are.  We try to talk ourselves in circles, convincing ourselves that we are
not good enough, or cant compete.  Strip away the *I* and it will be easier to remove this issue by taking action and course correcting.

I often say not to *Identify* with your problems, and instead find a *Strategy* for them.  If there is something you need to fix, such as procrastination
then don't say "I procrastinate", instead ask, "Why do I not complete tasks earlier?". From this you will find more and more answers until you have an actionable result.
Maybe it is because you don't get enough sleep. Why? Follow this trail of whys 5 times and you will surely end at the root cause of the issue you wish to fix.

> "Business opportunities are like buses; there's always another coming around." -- Richard Branson

Don't fret over missed opportunities, learn from them so that you can take more advantage of the next one.

> Is our perspective truly giving us *perspective* or is it what's actually causing the problem?

We have to realize that our view is not always the best, and in many cases causes us all of our problems.

> If effort would affect the outcome, he would die on the field before he let that chance go to waste.

Talking about Tommy John, one of baseball's most savvy and durable pitchers.

When someone wants an outcome to no end, that is where you get to see how deeply someone cares.  It is all too common to
talk about wanting something, but not willing to put in the work to get it.

> As a professional athlete his [Tommy John] job was to parse the difference between the unlikely and the impossible.

There are a lot of times where we take things that are hard and label them as not possible.  Often the root cause of this
is that we don't want to put in the energy or commit fully to trying something full force.

> The most harmful dragon we chase is the one that makes us think we can change things that are simply not ours to change.

Get negative thoughts about what we can't control out, then we can focus on the real issues.  Otherwise we just let our emotions
spin around aimlessly.

> "We cannot spend the day in explanation." -- Emerson
> Don't waste time on false constructs.

Time spent not taking action is usually wasted.  This reminds me of the idea of the manager versus producer.  For the 
producer, the more time that is spend either explaining, or having things explained to (meetings), inherently means
that less will be produced.  For managers however, if done right, a day spent in explanation could be beneficial as that
is ofter the entire role.

> Remember that this moment ins not your life, it's just a moment *in* your life.

Winston said it best, "If you are going through hell, keep going"

> To him [Steve Jobs], when you factored in vision and work ethic, much of life was malleable.

It is easy to tell someone they can't do something, but grit and work ethic push through all that bullshit.  There are so
few people who have these skills that what you will be able to do will look superhuman
