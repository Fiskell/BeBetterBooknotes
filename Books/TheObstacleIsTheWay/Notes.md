Why I chose it
======
I have read many books on Stoicism and have adopted many methods into my life of stoic thinking.  The book I come back to
again and again is 'The Art of Living' by Sharon Lebell.  It really struck a cord and made me want to dig deeper.
The obstacle is the way has been a book that pop's up in countless articles and podcasts, reinforcing my need to give it a read.
Stoicism has been so influential within my own life that this book was chosen as the first book in our 'Be Better Bookclub' at my work.

Notes
======

Preface
------
> *The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.*

This powerful quote is where the title of the book comes from.


> [stoicism] A formula for thriving not just in spite of whatever happens but *because of it*.

Another quote about obstacles, this one reminds me a bit of how overcoming failures is an antifragile system
